With 9050 new games released on Steam alone in 2018, each desperately fight for screen time.",motivation_message_2:"For Indie Game Developers, simply getting a game noticed therefore becomes an even more monumental task than in the past. Naturally due to limited resources, Indie Developers face an increasingly difficult task to raise awareness about their games.",motivation_memo:'1 "\u2022 Number of games released on Steam 2018 | Statistic - Statista."

However, due to the lack of resources, this is usually closer to being a fantasy than a practical strategy.",gamers_title:"Gamers",gamers_sub_title:"Gamers face a similar set of pain points, but from the other perspective.",gamers_ownership_title:"Ownership",gamers_ownership_message:"Many games in recent years sell virtual items, whether directly or via loot box mechanics. Unlike how traditionally owning a game meant having a physically copy, this ownership model means players are at the mercy of the developer\u2019s servers. Players own the items only if the servers are alive and the developer doesn\u2019t run out of business.",gamers_addiction_title:"Addiction",gamers_addiction_message:"A game that\u2019s considered addicting is usually a good thing, meaning that it\u2019s fun and players want to come back to play. However, after a certain point, this becomes unhealthy.",gamers_barrier_title:"Barrier to try new games",gamers_barrier_message:"Finding time to even try new games is also increasingly more difficult. Games employ numerous tactics such as daily quests and time limited events to entice players to spend at least a certain amount of time everyday.

With a way to provide data to one another, partnered games simply need to decide how to interpret each others\u2019 data.",ownership_title:"Asset Ownership",ownership_message_1:"Ownership in most online games can be considered as virtual as the virtual assets themselves. Players own the assets as long as the games\u2019 servers are alive. Which means once the developers decide that it\u2019s not worth keeping the servers alive and shut them down, the players lose all the assets that they\u2019ve spent money to acquire.",ownership_message_2:"With Agora, the data is stored on a blockchain instead, which means players would continue to possess the data even after the servers stop running. Players would be able to continue to use that data in other supported games, and also if a developer decides to revive the original game.",freedom_title:"Gaming Freedom",freedom_message_1:"It\u2019s natural for developers to design games in a way that encourages players to keep playing and come back with mechanics such as daily quests and limit time events.",freedom_message_2:"On the flip side, this means players run the risk of losing rewards when they take a break and switch games. Without the chance to try new things, players can start feeling trapped, and the game can end up feeling more like work than fun.",freedom_message_3:"Agora provides the potential for players to continue to earn rewards for a certain game even when playing a different partnered game, allowing players to freely try new games. This helps keep the experience fresh and enjoyment for players, as well as encouraging players to spend.",freedom_message_4:"Typically, convincing a player to spend money on an online game meant convincing them that this game is and will stay fun, and will survive for the foreseeable future.",freedom_message_5:"With Agora, these risks would be mitigated as long as there are other partner games using the data.",technology_title:"Technology",technology_message_1:"Agora will be a proprietary blockchain using Proof-of-Stake consensus that connects to the Cosmos Network.

Likewise, the chain will collect a small fee from transactions on the chain, but those are values mainly for discouraging spam and abuse.",roadmap_title:"Roadmap",roadmap_pos_title:"Proof of Stake chain implementation",roadmap_pos_message:"This is the actual implementation of the chain itself.",roadmap_testnet_title:"Testnet Launch",roadmap_testnet_message:"While we do intend to launch testnet with a version of a mobile wallet and auction website, they will be far from complete.
